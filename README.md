# dotfiles
My Arch Linux dotfiles - most of the configuration files are from other people.

**Make sure to edit the configuration file, as it will automatically set your resolution to 1368x768, etc etc**

The unsplash.sh goes into the `~/bin/` directory (do not question why it's in home.) and gives you a randomized wallpaper, you can optionally turn on so it also changes your terminal color based on the wallpaper by uncommenting the `wal -i` command.

*I use arch btw*
